# Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) for Single and Meta-Analysis of Brain Tissue 
       
An eQTL is a locus that explains a fraction of the genetic variance of a gene expression phenotype. Standard eQTL analysis involves a direct association test between markers of genetic variation with gene expression levels typically measured in tens or hundreds of individuals.           
    
This code allows for eQTL analysis of single tissue or combining tissues into a meta-analysis.
